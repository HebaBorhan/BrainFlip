# Brain Flip
BrainFlip is a project born from months of collaboration between my teammate and me at ALX Program; we have been working together on all Team Projects. 

Inspired by our desire to create a fun and engaging way to improve memory skills, and with a shared love for Harry Potter, we decided to theme our memory game around this magical world. 

As a Portfolio Project for ALX, we are eager to share our journey and we hope you enjoy playing BrainFlip as much as we enjoyed creating it!
